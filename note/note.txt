Create and run server
  we wanna create backend in the root directory the reason we are doing that when we deploy the application so that the server is going to read the file inside the root directory and understand our code so we need to put the packages.json for the backend inside the root directory
To create a packages.json file
  8. npm init -y
To create a server need to install express
  9.npm i express

we have to change type in packages.json file to module now run the server by node api/index.js
