First of all we need to create a folder where which will contain some other folders one of them is client folder which will contain frontend of the website to create a client folder we use 
  1. npm create vite@latest
Then have to chose name of the project that will be client that then framework in this case we will use React after that variant will js + swc for frister compilation 

Now we have to install all dependencies that folder are created but not install yeat 
so that go to client folder and
  2. npm i 
   to install
Now we need to install tailwind css
  3. npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
